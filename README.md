# About

This repository provides a Demo web interface for the abstract-syntax-annotator (https://github.com/Mmaz1988/abstract-syntax-annotator-web). 
The abstract syntax annotator translates linguistic annotation into graphs (native support for XLE representations and Stanford CoreNLP dependency representations)
and defines a parser for linguistic rewrite rules that alllow to modify and expand linguistic annotations. To test this system, simply run it in a browser (Chrome is recommended)
and run the abstract syntax annotator web-service.
